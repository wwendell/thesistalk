It is shown that at short times it has a substantial component of directed motion, with a velocity that depends on the concentration of fuel molecules. At longer times, the motion reverts to a random walk with a substantially enhanced diffusion coefficient. Our results suggest strategies for designing artificial chemotactic systems.},

  volume = {68},
  shorttitle = {Jamming at zero temperature and zero applied stress},
  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.68.011306},
  abstract = {We have studied how two- and three-dimensional systems made up of particles interacting with finite range, repulsive potentials jam (i.e., develop a yield stress in a disordered state) at zero temperature and zero applied stress. At low packing fractions φ, the system is not jammed and each particle can move without impediment from its neighbors. For each configuration, there is a unique jamming threshold φc at which particles can no longer avoid each other, and the bulk and shear moduli simultaneously become nonzero. The distribution of φc values becomes narrower as the system size increases, so that essentially all configurations jam at the same packing fraction in the thermodynamic limit. This packing fraction corresponds to the previously measured value for random close packing. In fact, our results provide a well-defined meaning for “random close packing” in terms of the fraction of all phase space with inherent structures that jam. The jamming threshold, point J, occurring at zero temperature and applied stress and at the random-close-packing density, has properties reminiscent of an ordinary critical point. As point J is approached from higher packing fractions, power-law scaling is found for the divergence of the first peak in the pair correlation function and in the vanishing of the pressure, shear modulus, and excess number of overlapping neighbors. Moreover, near point J, certain quantities no longer self-average, suggesting the existence of a length scale that diverges at J. However, point J also differs from an ordinary critical point: the scaling exponents do not depend on dimension but do depend on the interparticle potential. Finally, as point J is approached from high packing fractions, the density of vibrational states develops a large excess of low-frequency modes. Indeed, at point J, the density of states is a constant all the way down to zero frequency. All of these results suggest that point J is a point of maximal disorder and may control behavior in its vicinity—perhaps even at the glass transition.},

We study isostatic jammed disk packings obtained via two protocols: isotropic compression and simple shear. We show that for frictionless systems, all jammed packings can be obtained via either protocol. However, the probability to obtain a particular jammed packing depends on the packing-generation protocol. We predict the average shear strain required to jam initially unjammed isotropically compressed packings from the density of jammed packings, shape of their basins of attraction, and path traversed in configuration space. We compare our predictions to simulations of shear strain-induced jamming and find quantitative agreement. We also show that the packing fraction range, over which shear strain-induced jamming occurs, tends to zero in the large system limit for frictionless packings with overdamped dynamics.},

  abstract = {The different roles the attractive and repulsive forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a Lennard‐Jones liquid are discussed. It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair‐correlation function) rather than the pair‐correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard‐Jones fluid. This reference system structure factor is calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate approximation described herein. The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription for calculating the radial distribution function of dense liquids which is more accurate than that obtained by any previously reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are presented in the form of calculations of the free energy, the internal energy (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from the virial equation). The implications of our conclusions to perturbation theories for liquids and to the interpretation of x‐ray scattering experiments are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a quantitative continuum theory of “flocking”: the collective coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. In agreement with everyday experience, our model predicts the existence of an “ordered phase” of flocks, in which all members of even an arbitrarily large flock move together with the same mean velocity ⟨v⃗ ⟩≠0. This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry: no preferred direction for the motion is picked out a priori in the model; rather, each flock is allowed to, and does, spontaneously pick out some completely arbitrary direction to move in. By analyzing our model we can make detailed, quantitative predictions for the long-distance, long-time behavior of this “broken symmetry state.” The “Goldstone modes” associated with this “spontaneously broken rotational symmetry” are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction of motion of the flock as a whole. These “Goldstone modes” mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock, far larger, at long wavelengths, than those in, e.g., an equilibrium gas. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time-dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an n=d component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions d\ensuremath{>}4, the long-distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory, and is equivalent to that of an unusual but nonetheless equilibrium model for spin systems. For d\ensuremath{<}4, nonlinear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in d=2, where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in d=2 (the “Mermin-Wagner” theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real flocks. We also consider an anisotropic model, in which the birds move preferentially in an “easy” (e.g., horizontal) plane, and make analogous, but quantitatively different, predictions for that model as well. For this anisotropic model, we obtain exact scaling exponents for all spatial dimensions, including the physically relevant case d=3.},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

Using molecular dynamics simulations of a model glass former, we show that the incorporation of activity or self-propulsion, f0, can induce cage breaking and fluidization, resulting in a disappearance of the glassy phase beyond a critical f0 . The diffusion coefficient crosses over from being strongly to weakly temperature dependent as f0 is increased. In addition, we demonstrate that activity induces a crossover from a fragile to a strong glass and a tendency for clustering of active particles. Our results are of direct relevance to the collective dynamics of dense active colloidal glasses and to recent experiments on tagged particle diffusion in living cells.},

  abstract = {Summary
Molecular motors in cells typically produce highly directed motion; however, the aggregate, incoherent effect of all active processes also creates randomly fluctuating forces, which drive diffusive-like, nonthermal motion. Here, we introduce force-spectrum-microscopy (FSM) to directly quantify random forces within the cytoplasm of cells and thereby probe stochastic motor activity. This technique combines measurements of the random motion of probe particles with independent micromechanical measurements of the cytoplasm to quantify the spectrum of force fluctuations. Using FSM, we show that force~fluctuations substantially enhance intracellular movement of small and large components. The fluctuations are three times larger in malignant cells than in their benign counterparts. We further demonstrate that vimentin acts globally to anchor organelles against randomly fluctuating forces in the cytoplasm, with no effect on their magnitude. Thus, FSM has broad applications for understanding the cytoplasm and its intracellular processes in relation to cell physiology in healthy and diseased states.},

  abstract = {Entangled polymer solutions and melts exhibit elastic, solid-like resistance to quick deformations and a viscous, fluid-like response to slow deformations. This viscoelastic behaviour reflects the dynamics of individual polymer chains driven by brownian motion: since individual chains can only move in a snake-like fashion through the mesh of surrounding polymer molecules, their diffusive transport, described by reptation, is so slow that the relaxation of suddenly imposed stress is delayed. Entangled polymer solutions and melts therefore elastically resist deforming motions that occur faster than the stress relaxation time. Here we show that the protein myosin II permits active control over the viscoelastic behaviour of actin filament solutions. We find that when each actin filament in a polymerized actin solution interacts with at least one myosin minifilament, the stress relaxation time of the polymer solution is significantly shortened. We attribute this effect to myosin's action as a 'molecular motor', which allows it to interact with randomly oriented actin filaments and push them through the solution, thus enhancing longitudinal filament motion. By superseding reptation with sliding motion, the molecular motors thus overcome a fundamental principle of complex fluids: that only depolymerization makes an entangled, isotropic polymer solution fluid for quick deformations.},

Here we review the biophysical and mechanical principles of locomotion at the small scales relevant to cell swimming, tens of micrometers and below. At this scale, inertia is unimportant and the Reynolds number is small. Our emphasis is on the simple physical picture and fundamental flow physics phenomena in this regime. We first give a brief overview of the mechanisms for swimming motility, and of the basic properties of flows at low Reynolds number, paying special attention to aspects most relevant for swimming such as resistance matrices for solid bodies, flow singularities and kinematic requirements for net translation. Then we review classical theoretical work on cell motility, in particular early calculations of swimming kinematics with prescribed stroke and the application of resistive force theory and slender-body theory to flagellar locomotion. After examining the physical means by which flagella are actuated, we outline areas of active research, including hydrodynamic interactions, biological locomotion in complex fluids, the design of small-scale artificial swimmers and the optimization of locomotion strategies.},

To investigate this hypothesis, we mapped the generic motion of large protein complexes in the bacterial cytoplasm through quantitative analysis of thousands of complete cell-cycle trajectories of fluorescently tagged ectopic MS2-mRNA complexes. We find the motion of these complexes in the cytoplasm is strongly dependent on their spatial position along the long axis of the cell, and that their dynamics are consistent with a quantitative model that requires only nucleoid exclusion and membrane confinement. This analysis also reveals that the nucleoid increases the mobility of MS2-mRNA complexes, resulting in a fourfold increase in diffusion coefficients between regions of the lowest and highest nucleoid density. These data provide strong quantitative support for two modes of nucleoid action: the widely accepted mechanism of nucleoid exclusion in organizing the cell and a newly proposed mode, in which the nucleoid facilitates rapid motion throughout the cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes theoretical progress in the field of active matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments. This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to phenomenological. In particular, first considered are “dry” systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next, the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or “wet” systems is discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case, as well as various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further highlighted are various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter analogs. Last, the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents, is summarized.},

The temperature that is commonly reported as this system’s mode-coupling transition temperature, in addition to being obtained from a power law fit, is a crossover temperature at which there is a change in the dynamics from the high-temperature homogeneous, diffusive relaxation to a heterogeneous, hopping-like motion. The hopping-like motion is evident in the probability distributions of the logarithm of single-particle displacements: approaching the commonly reported mode-coupling temperature these distributions start exhibiting two peaks. Notably, the temperature at which the hopping-like motion appears for the smaller particles is slightly higher than that at which the hopping-like motion appears for the larger ones. We define and calculate a new non-Gaussian parameter whose maximum occurs approximately at the time at which the two peaks in the probability distribution of the logarithm of displacements are most evident.},

Glass formation is a generic phenomenon, observed in physically quite distinct systems that encompass hard and soft particles. It is believed that a common underlying scenario, namely cage formation, drives dynamical arrest, especially at high concentrations. Here, we identify a novel, asymmetric glassy state in soft colloidal mixtures, which is characterized by strongly anisotropically distorted cages, bearing similarities to those of hard-sphere glasses under shear. The anisotropy is induced by the presence of soft additives. This phenomenon seems to be generic to soft colloids and its origins lie in the penetrability of the constituent particles. The resulting phase diagram for mixtures of soft particles is clearly distinct from that of hard-sphere mixtures and brings forward a rich variety of vitrified states that delineate an ergodic lake in the parameter space spanned by the size ratio between the two components and by the concentration of the additives.

The size of this cooperatively rearranging region is shown to be determined by configuration restrictions in these glass‐forming liquids and is expressed in terms of their configurational entropy. The result of the theory is a relation practically coinciding with the empirical WLF equation. Application of the theory to viscosimetric experiments permits evaluation of the ratio of the kinetic glass temperature Tg (derived from usual ``quasistatic\&apos;\&apos; experiments) to the equilibrium second‐order transition temperature T 2 (indicated by either statistical‐mechanical theory or extrapolations of experimental data) as well as the hindrance‐free energy per molecule. These parameters have been evaluated for fifteen substances, the experimental data for which were available. Hindrance‐free energies were found to be of the magnitude to be expected from consideration of molecular interaction energies. The values of Tg/T 2 thus obtained for these fifteen widely differing materials were found to be nearly the same, i.e., 1.30±8.4\%. Values for Tg/T 2 of nearly the same magnitude were derived by Bestul and Chang from calorimetric data.},

To achieve a realistic modeling of processes in the living cell based on biochemical data, it becomes necessary, therefore, to consider such effects. We describe a protocol based on Brownian dynamics simulation to characterize and quantify the effect of various forms of crowding on diffusion and bimolecular association in a simple model of interacting hard spheres. We show that by combining the elastic collision method for hard spheres and the mean field approach for hydrodynamic interaction (HI), our simulations capture the correct dynamics of a monodisperse system. The contributions from excluded volume effect and HI to the crowding effect are thus quantified. The dependence of the results on size distribution of each component in the system is illustrated, and the approach is applied as well to the crowding effect on electrostatic-driven association in both neutral and charged environments; values for effective diffusion constants and association rates are obtained for the specific conditions. The results from our simulation approach can be used to improve the modeling of cell signaling processes without additional computational burdens.},

The stimulation of protein aggregation by crowding might account for the existence of molecular chaperones that combat this effect. Positive results of crowding include enhancing the collapse of polypeptide chains into functional proteins, the assembly of oligomeric structures and the efficiency of action of some molecular chaperones and metabolic pathways.},

Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

  abstract = {The rate of protein diffusion in bacterial cytoplasm may constrain a variety of cellular functions and limit the rates of many biochemical reactions in vivo. In this paper, we report noninvasive measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. These measurements were made in two ways: by photobleaching of GFP fluorescence and by photoactivation of a red-emitting fluorescent state of GFP (M. B. Elowitz, M. G. Surette, P. E. Wolf, J. Stock, and S. Leibler, Curr. Biol. 7:809–812, 1997). The apparent diffusion coefficient,Da , of GFP in E. coli DH5α was found to be 7.7 ± 2.5 μm2/s. A 72-kDa fusion protein composed of GFP and a cytoplasmically localized maltose binding protein domain moves more slowly, with Da of 2.5 ± 0.6 μm2/s. In addition, GFP mobility can depend strongly on at least two factors: first,Da is reduced to 3.6 ± 0.7 μm2/s at high levels of GFP expression; second, the addition to GFP of a small tag consisting of six histidine residues reduces Da to 4.0 ± 2.0 μm2/s. Thus, a single effective cytoplasmic viscosity cannot explain all values of Da reported here. These measurements have implications for the understanding of intracellular biochemical networks.},

  abstract = {The very high concentration of macromolecules within cells can potentially have an overwhelming effect on the thermodynamic activity of cellular components because of excluded volume effects. To estimate the magnitudes of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes, concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be ≈0.3 to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: The ribosome — essential for protein synthesis in all organisms — has been an evasive target for structural studies. The best available structures for the 70S Escherichia coli ribosome or its 30S and 50S subunits are based on electron microscopical tilt experiments and are limited in resolution to 28–55 å. The angular reconstitution approach, which exploits the random orientations of particles within a vitreous ice matrix, can be used in conjunction with cryo-electron microscopy to yield a higher-resolution structure.

Results Our 23 å resolution map of the 70S ribosome elucidates many structural details, such as an extensive system of channels within the 50S subunit and an inter-subunit gap ideally shaped to accommodate two transfer RNA molecules. The resolution achieved is sufficient to allow the preliminary fitting of double-helical regions of an earlier three-dimensional ribosomal RNA model.

Conclusion Although we are still a long way from attaining an atomic-resolution structure of the ribosome, cryo-electron microscopy, in combination with angular reconstitution, is likely to yield three-dimensional maps with gradually increasing resolution. As exemplified by our current 23 å reconstruction, these maps will lead to progressive refinement of models of the ribosomal RNA.},

  abstract = {DNA added to concentrated extracts of Escherichia coli undergoes a reversible transition to a readily-sedimentable (‘condensed’) form. The transition occurs over a relatively small increment in extract concentration.

The extract appears to play two roles in this transition, supplying both DNA-binding protein(s) and a crowded environment that increases protein binding and favors compact DNA conformations. The two roles of the extract are suggested by properties of fractions prepared by absorption of extracts with DNA-cellulose. The DNA-binding fraction and the DNA-nonbinding fractions from these columns are separately poorer condensing agents than the original extract, but when rejoined are similar to the original extract in the amount required for condensation. The dual role for the extract is supported by model studies of condensation with combinations of purified DNA-binding materials (protein HU or spermidine) and concentrated solutions of crowding agents (albumin or polyethylene glycol 8000); in each case, crowding agents and DNA-binding materials jointly reduce the amounts of each other required for condensation. The condensation reaction as studied in extracts or in the purified systems may be a useful approach to the forces which stabilize the compact form of DNA within the bacterial nucleoid.

The effect of condensation on the reactivity of the DNA was measured by changes in the rate of cohesion between duplex DNA molecules bearing the complementary single-strand termini of λ DNA. Condensation caused large increases in the rates of cohesion of both λ DNA and of restriction fragments of λ DNA bearing the cohesive termini. Cohesion products of λ DNA made in vitro are a mixture of linear and circular aggregates, whereas those made in vivo are cyclic monomers. We suggest a simple mechanism based upon condensation at the site of viral injection which may explain this discrepancy.},

  abstract = {The nonideal properties of solutions containing high concentrations of macromolecules can result in enormous increases in the activity of the individual macromolecules. It has been proposed that molecular crowding and confinement occur in cells and are major determinants of the activity of the proteins and other intracellular macromolecules. This concept has important implications for cell volume regulation because, under crowded conditions, relatively small changes in concentration, consequent to alterations of water content, lead to large changes in macromolecular activity. This review considers several aspects of macromolecular crowding and confinement, including: 1) the physical chemical principles involved; 2) in vitro demonstrations of the effects; 3) relation to water activity; 4) estimates of the actual intracellular activity of water and macromolecules; 5) relation to osmotic regulation in various types of cells, including bacteria, red blood cells, and complex nucleated cells; and 6) the relation to inorganic ions and organic osmolytes in cells stressed by hypertonicity. We conclude that, while there is compelling evidence for important effects of molecular crowding in vitro and in red blood cells, the role of macromolecular crowding and confinement in osmotic regulation of more complex cells is an open question that deserves the extensive attention it is currently receiving.},

  abstract = {The water-accessible volumes, the amounts of all significant osmolytes, and the protein concentration in the cytoplasm of aerobically grown Escherichia coli K-12 have been determined as a function of the osmolarity of the minimal growth medium. The volume of cytoplasmic water (V̄cyto) decreases linearly with increasing osmolarity from 2.23(±0.12) μl/mg dry weight in cells grown at 0.10 osm to 1.18(±0.06) μl/mg dry weight at 1.02 osm. Above 0.28 osm, growth rate decreases linearly with increasing osmolarity. The growth rate extrapolates to zero at an osmolarity of approximately 1.8, corresponding to an estimated V̄cyto of 0.5(±0.2) μl/mg dry weight. Measurements of V̄cyto in titrations of non-growing cells with the plasmolyzing agent NaCl were used to obtain volumes of “bound” water (presumably water of macromolecular hydration) and cytoplasmic osmotic coefficients for cells grown in medium of low (0.10 osm) and moderate (0.28 osm) osmolarity. The volume of bound water V̄b is similar in the two osmotic conditions (V̄b = 0.40(±0.04) μl/mg dry wt), and corresponds to approximately 0.5 g H2O/g cytoplasmic macromolecule. Since V̄cyto decreases with increasing osmolarity, whereas V̄b appears to be independent of osmolarity, water of hydration becomes a larger fraction of V̄cyto as the osmolarity of the growth medium increases. Growth appears to cease at the osmolarity where V̄cyto is approximately equal to V̄b. K+ and glutamate (Glu−) are the only significant cytoplasmic osmolytes in cells grown in medium of low osmolarity. The amount of K+ greatly exceeds that of Glu−. Analysis of cytoplasmic electroneutrality indicates that the cytoplasm behaves like a concentrated solution of the K+ salt of cytoplasmic polyanions, in which the amount of additional electrolyte (K+ Glu−) increases with increasing osmolarity. As the osmolarity of the growth medium becomes very low, the cytoplasm approaches an electrolyte-free K+-polyanion solution. In vivo osmotic coefficients were determined from the variation of V̄cyto with external osmolarity in plasmolysis titrations of non-growing cells. The values obtained (φ = 0.54(±0.06) for cells grown at 0.10 osm and φ = 0.71(±0.11) at 0.28 osm) indicate a high degree of non-ideality of intracellular ions arising from coulombic interactions between K+ and cytoplasmic polyanions. Analysis of these osmotic coefficients using polyelectrolyte theory indicates that the thermodynamic activity of cytoplasmic K+ increases from approximately 0.14 m in cells grown at an external osmolarity of 0.10 osm to approximately 0.76 m at 1.02 osm. The amounts of protein and nucleic acid per unit cell dry weight appear to be independent of external osmolarity. Since V̄cyto decreases with external osmolarity, the concentration of cytoplasmic protein increases from approximately 200 mg/ml in cells grown at 0.10 osm to approximately 320 mg/ml at 1.02 osm. The RNA concentration increases from approximately 75 mg/ml to approximately 120 mg/ml over this range. Scaled particle theory predicts that this increase in macromolecular concentration will cause the activity coefficients of typical cytoplasmic proteins to increase by several orders of magnitude. Such an increase in activity coefficients of DNA-binding proteins with increasing osmolarity appears to be sufficient to counter the expected effect of the concomitant increase in the thermodynamic activity of K+ on protein-DNA interactions. This compensation may explain the anomalous lack of dependence of protein-DNA interactions in vivo on {[}K+] and external osmolarity. Differential crowding effects as a function of external osmolarity should affect cell phenotype. For example, the ability of high osmolarity to restore the wild-type phenotype of certain conditional lethal mutants of E. coli (classified as “osmotic remedial” mutants) may be a manifestation of the effect of increased macromolecular crowding on the stability and assembly of proteins in the cytoplasm of cells grown at high osmolarity.},

The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components.},

We present a quantitative study of molecular motions in cells over times from milliseconds to hours. Noninvasive tracking was accomplished by imaging highly stable near-infrared luminescence of single-walled carbon nanotubes targeted to kinesin-1 motor proteins in COS-7 cells. We observed a regime of active random “stirring” that constitutes an intermediate mode of transport, different from both thermal diffusion and directed motor activity. High-frequency motion was found to be thermally driven. At times greater than 100 milliseconds, nonequilibrium dynamics dominated. In addition to directed transport along microtubules, we observed strong random dynamics driven by myosins that result in enhanced nonspecific transport. We present a quantitative model connecting molecular mechanisms to mesoscopic fluctuations.
Motors stirring within the living cell
Cytoskeletal dynamics is key to cellular function. At very short time scales, thermal motions probably dominate, whereas on time scales from minutes to hours, motor-protein-12–based directed transport is dominant. But what about the times in between? Fakhri et al. tracked kinesin molecules labeled with carbon nanotubes and monitored their motion in living cells for milliseconds to hours. The kinesins motored along microtubule tracks, but sometimes moved more randomly as the tracks themselves were moved by active, larger-scale cell movements. This active “stirring” of the cytoplasm may play a role in nonspecific transport.

This technique combines measurements of the random motion of probe particles with independent micromechanical measurements of the cytoplasm to quantify the spectrum of force fluctuations. Using FSM, we show that force~fluctuations substantially enhance intracellular movement of small and large components. The fluctuations are three times larger in malignant cells than in their benign counterparts. We further demonstrate that vimentin acts globally to anchor organelles against randomly fluctuating forces in the cytoplasm, with no effect on their magnitude. Thus, FSM has broad applications for understanding the cytoplasm and its intracellular processes in relation to cell physiology in healthy and diseased states.},

The results are in close agreement with experimental or previously simulated values, where available. Control simulations without HI showed that use of HI is essential to obtain accurate diffusion coefficients. Anomalous diffusion inside the crowded cellular medium was investigated with Fractional Brownian motion analysis, and found to be present in this model. By running a series of control simulations in which various forces were removed systematically, it was found that repulsive interactions (volume exclusion) are the main cause for anomalous diffusion, with a secondary contribution from HI.},

Some mRNPs were partially corralled throughout the nonhomogenous nuclear environment, but no accumulation at subnuclear domains was observed. Following energy deprivation, energy-independent motion of mRNPs was observed in a highly ATP-dependent nuclear environment; movements were constrained to chromatin-poor domains and excluded by newly formed chromatin barriers. This observation resolves a controversy, showing that the energetic requirements of nuclear mRNP trafficking are consistent with a diffusional model.},

Anomalous diffusion, in which mean squared displacement does not increase linearly with time, is predicted in simulations of solute diffusion in media crowded with fixed or mobile obstacles, or when solute diffusion is restricted or accelerated by a variety of geometric or active transport processes. Experimental measurements of solute diffusion in solutions and cellular aqueous compartments, however, generally show Brownian diffusion. In cell membranes, there are examples of both Brownian and anomalous diffusion, with the latter likely produced by lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. We conclude that the notion of universally anomalous diffusion in cells as a consequence of molecular crowding is not correct and that slowing of diffusion in cells is less marked than has been generally assumed.},

  abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have determined that the nature of dynamical heterogeneity in jammed liquids is very sensitive to short-ranged attractions. Weakly attractive systems differ little from dense hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones fluids. Particle motion is punctuated and tends to proceed in steps of roughly a single particle diameter. Both of these basic features change in the presence of appreciable short-ranged attractions. Transient periods of particle mobility and immobility cannot be discerned at intermediate attraction strength, for which structural relaxation is greatly enhanced. Strong attractions, known to dramatically inhibit relaxation, restore bimodality of particle motion. But in this regime, transiently mobile particles move in steps that are significantly more biased toward large displacements than those in the case of weak attractions. This modified feature of dynamical heterogeneity, which cannot be captured by conventional mode coupling theory, verifies recent predictions from a model of spatially correlated facilitating defects.},

  abstract = {Dynamical heterogeneities in a colloidal fluid close to gelation are studied by means of computer simulations. A clear distinction between some fast particles and the rest, slow ones, is observed yielding a picture of the gel composed of two populations with different mobilities. Analyzing the statics and dynamics of both sets of particles, it is shown that the slow particles form a network of stuck particles, whereas the fast ones are able to move over long distances. Correlation functions show that the environment of the fast particles relaxes much faster than that of the slow ones, but at short times the bonds between fast particles are longer lived due to the flexibility of their structure. No stringlike motion is observed for the fast particles, but they occupy preferential sites in the surface of the structure formed by the slow ones.},

  abstract = {Recently we presented a new technique for numerical simulations of colloidal hard-sphere systems and showed its high efficiency. Here, we extend our calculations to the treatment of both 2- and 3-dimensional monodisperse and 3-dimensional polydisperse systems (with sampled finite Gaussian size distribution of particle radii), focusing on equilibrium pair distribution functions and structure factors as well as volume fractions of random close packing (RCP). The latter were determined using in principle the same technique as Woodcock or Stillinger had used. Results for the monodisperse 3-dimensional system show very good agreement compared to both pair distribution and structure factor predicted by the Percus-Yevick approximation for the fluid state (volume fractions up to 0.50). We were not able to find crystalline 3d systems at volume fractions 0.50–0.58 as shown by former simulations of Reeet al. or experiments of Pusey and van Megen, due to the fact that we used random start configurations and no constraints of particle positions as in the cell model of Hoover and Ree, and effects of the overall entropy of the system, responsible for the melting and freezing phase transitions, are neglected in our calculations. Nevertheless, we obtained reasonable results concerning concentration-dependent long-time selfdiffusion coefficients (as shown before) and equilibrium structure of samples in the fluid state, and the determination of the volume fraction of random close packing (RCP, glassy state). As expected, polydispersity increases the respective volume fraction of RCP due to the decrease in free volume by the fraction of the smaller spheres which fill gaps between the larger particles.},

  abstract = {Freezing of polydisperse hard spheres is studied by Monte Carlo simulation and the results are interpreted with a cell model of the solid. The results supplement an earlier study of freezing of nearly monodisperse hard spheres and, within the assumption of a substitutionally disordered solid, a complete description of the freezing behavior is obtained. The density and polydispersity of the precipitate are characterized by a single curve, regardless of the composition of the fluid from which it is formed. Fractionation enables a fluid of arbitrary polydispersity to precipitate a solid of small polydispersity, dispeling the long-held notion of a fluid-phase “critical” polydispersity, beyond which it cannot form a solid. Nevertheless, a primary conclusion from the previous study is confirmed: a solid crystalline phase of polydispersity exceeding 5.7\% of the average sphere diameter cannot be precipitated from a fluid phase.},
