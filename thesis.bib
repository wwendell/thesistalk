It is shown that at short times it has a substantial component of directed motion, with a velocity that depends on the concentration of fuel molecules. At longer times, the motion reverts to a random walk with a substantially enhanced diffusion coefficient. Our results suggest strategies for designing artificial chemotactic systems.},

  shorttitle = {Jamming at zero temperature and zero applied stress},
  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.68.011306},
  abstract = {We have studied how two- and three-dimensional systems made up of particles interacting with finite range, repulsive potentials jam (i.e., develop a yield stress in a disordered state) at zero temperature and zero applied stress. At low packing fractions \ensuremath{\varphi}, the system is not jammed and each particle can move without impediment from its neighbors. For each configuration, there is a unique jamming threshold \ensuremath{\varphi}c at which particles can no longer avoid each other, and the bulk and shear moduli simultaneously become nonzero. The distribution of \ensuremath{\varphi}c values becomes narrower as the system size increases, so that essentially all configurations jam at the same packing fraction in the thermodynamic limit. This packing fraction corresponds to the previously measured value for random close packing. In fact, our results provide a well-defined meaning for {\textquotedblleft}random close packing{\textquotedblright} in terms of the fraction of all phase space with inherent structures that jam. The jamming threshold, point J, occurring at zero temperature and applied stress and at the random-close-packing density, has properties reminiscent of an ordinary critical point. As point J is approached from higher packing fractions, power-law scaling is found for the divergence of the first peak in the pair correlation function and in the vanishing of the pressure, shear modulus, and excess number of overlapping neighbors. Moreover, near point J, certain quantities no longer self-average, suggesting the existence of a length scale that diverges at J. However, point J also differs from an ordinary critical point: the scaling exponents do not depend on dimension but do depend on the interparticle potential. Finally, as point J is approached from high packing fractions, the density of vibrational states develops a large excess of low-frequency modes. Indeed, at point J, the density of states is a constant all the way down to zero frequency. All of these results suggest that point J is a point of maximal disorder and may control behavior in its vicinity{\textemdash}perhaps even at the glass transition.},

We study isostatic jammed disk packings obtained via two protocols: isotropic compression and simple shear. We show that for frictionless systems, all jammed packings can be obtained via either protocol. However, the probability to obtain a particular jammed packing depends on the packing-generation protocol. We predict the average shear strain required to jam initially unjammed isotropically compressed packings from the density of jammed packings, shape of their basins of attraction, and path traversed in configuration space. We compare our predictions to simulations of shear strain-induced jamming and find quantitative agreement. We also show that the packing fraction range, over which shear strain-induced jamming occurs, tends to zero in the large system limit for frictionless packings with overdamped dynamics.},

  abstract = {The different roles the attractive and repulsive forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a Lennard-Jones liquid are discussed. It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair-correlation function) rather than the pair-correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard-Jones fluid. This reference system structure factor is calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate approximation described herein. The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription for calculating the radial distribution function of dense liquids which is more accurate than that obtained by any previously reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are presented in the form of calculations of the free energy, the internal energy (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from the virial equation). The implications of our conclusions to perturbation theories for liquids and to the interpretation of x-ray scattering experiments are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a quantitative continuum theory of {\textquotedblleft}flocking{\textquotedblright}: the collective coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. In agreement with everyday experience, our model predicts the existence of an {\textquotedblleft}ordered phase{\textquotedblright} of flocks, in which all members of even an arbitrarily large flock move together with the same mean velocity {\langle}vâƒ— {\rangle}\ensuremath{\not =}0. This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry: no preferred direction for the motion is picked out a priori in the model; rather, each flock is allowed to, and does, spontaneously pick out some completely arbitrary direction to move in. By analyzing our model we can make detailed, quantitative predictions for the long-distance, long-time behavior of this {\textquotedblleft}broken symmetry state.{\textquotedblright} The {\textquotedblleft}Goldstone modes{\textquotedblright} associated with this {\textquotedblleft}spontaneously broken rotational symmetry{\textquotedblright} are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction of motion of the flock as a whole. These {\textquotedblleft}Goldstone modes{\textquotedblright} mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock, far larger, at long wavelengths, than those in, e.g., an equilibrium gas. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time-dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an n=d component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions d\ensuremath{>}4, the long-distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory, and is equivalent to that of an unusual but nonetheless equilibrium model for spin systems. For d\ensuremath{<}4, nonlinear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in d=2, where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in d=2 (the {\textquotedblleft}Mermin-Wagner{\textquotedblright} theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real flocks. We also consider an anisotropic model, in which the birds move preferentially in an {\textquotedblleft}easy{\textquotedblright} (e.g., horizontal) plane, and make analogous, but quantitatively different, predictions for that model as well. For this anisotropic model, we obtain exact scaling exponents for all spatial dimensions, including the physically relevant case d=3.},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

Using molecular dynamics simulations of a model glass former, we show that the incorporation of activity or self-propulsion, f0, can induce cage breaking and fluidization, resulting in a disappearance of the glassy phase beyond a critical f0 . The diffusion coefficient crosses over from being strongly to weakly temperature dependent as f0 is increased. In addition, we demonstrate that activity induces a crossover from a fragile to a strong glass and a tendency for clustering of active particles. Our results are of direct relevance to the collective dynamics of dense active colloidal glasses and to recent experiments on tagged particle diffusion in living cells.},

  abstract = {Summary
Molecular motors in cells typically produce highly directed motion; however, the aggregate, incoherent effect of all active processes also creates randomly fluctuating forces, which drive diffusive-like, nonthermal motion. Here, we introduce force-spectrum-microscopy (FSM) to directly quantify random forces within the cytoplasm of cells and thereby probe stochastic motor activity. This technique combines measurements of the random motion of probe particles with independent micromechanical measurements of the cytoplasm to quantify the spectrum of force fluctuations. Using FSM, we show that force~fluctuations substantially enhance intracellular movement of small and large components. The fluctuations are three times larger in malignant cells than in their benign counterparts. We further demonstrate that vimentin acts globally to anchor organelles against randomly fluctuating forces in the cytoplasm, with no effect on their magnitude. Thus, FSM has broad applications for understanding the cytoplasm and its intracellular processes in relation to cell physiology in healthy and diseased states.},

  abstract = {Entangled polymer solutions and melts exhibit elastic, solid-like resistance to quick deformations and a viscous, fluid-like response to slow deformations. This viscoelastic behaviour reflects the dynamics of individual polymer chains driven by brownian motion: since individual chains can only move in a snake-like fashion through the mesh of surrounding polymer molecules, their diffusive transport, described by reptation, is so slow that the relaxation of suddenly imposed stress is delayed. Entangled polymer solutions and melts therefore elastically resist deforming motions that occur faster than the stress relaxation time. Here we show that the protein myosin II permits active control over the viscoelastic behaviour of actin filament solutions. We find that when each actin filament in a polymerized actin solution interacts with at least one myosin minifilament, the stress relaxation time of the polymer solution is significantly shortened. We attribute this effect to myosin's action as a 'molecular motor', which allows it to interact with randomly oriented actin filaments and push them through the solution, thus enhancing longitudinal filament motion. By superseding reptation with sliding motion, the molecular motors thus overcome a fundamental principle of complex fluids: that only depolymerization makes an entangled, isotropic polymer solution fluid for quick deformations.},

Here we review the biophysical and mechanical principles of locomotion at the small scales relevant to cell swimming, tens of micrometers and below. At this scale, inertia is unimportant and the Reynolds number is small. Our emphasis is on the simple physical picture and fundamental flow physics phenomena in this regime. We first give a brief overview of the mechanisms for swimming motility, and of the basic properties of flows at low Reynolds number, paying special attention to aspects most relevant for swimming such as resistance matrices for solid bodies, flow singularities and kinematic requirements for net translation. Then we review classical theoretical work on cell motility, in particular early calculations of swimming kinematics with prescribed stroke and the application of resistive force theory and slender-body theory to flagellar locomotion. After examining the physical means by which flagella are actuated, we outline areas of active research, including hydrodynamic interactions, biological locomotion in complex fluids, the design of small-scale artificial swimmers and the optimization of locomotion strategies.},

To investigate this hypothesis, we mapped the generic motion of large protein complexes in the bacterial cytoplasm through quantitative analysis of thousands of complete cell-cycle trajectories of fluorescently tagged ectopic MS2-mRNA complexes. We find the motion of these complexes in the cytoplasm is strongly dependent on their spatial position along the long axis of the cell, and that their dynamics are consistent with a quantitative model that requires only nucleoid exclusion and membrane confinement. This analysis also reveals that the nucleoid increases the mobility of MS2-mRNA complexes, resulting in a fourfold increase in diffusion coefficients between regions of the lowest and highest nucleoid density. These data provide strong quantitative support for two modes of nucleoid action: the widely accepted mechanism of nucleoid exclusion in organizing the cell and a newly proposed mode, in which the nucleoid facilitates rapid motion throughout the cytoplasm.},

Finally, we consider not only the free and confined individual active dynamics but also different types of interaction between active particles.

This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to phenomenological. In particular, first considered are {\textquotedblleft}dry{\textquotedblright} systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next, the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or {\textquotedblleft}wet{\textquotedblright} systems is discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case, as well as various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further highlighted are various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter analogs. Last, the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents, is summarized.},

In lipid bilayers, the effects are strongly nonlocal, so that active inclusions in the entire membrane contribute to local diffusion enhancement and the drift.

We find that in accordance with mode-coupling theory the self-diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time show power-law dependence on temperature. However, different mode-coupling temperatures and power laws can be obtained from the simulation data depending on the range of temperatures chosen for the power-law fits. The temperature that is commonly reported as this system's mode-coupling transition temperature, in addition to being obtained from a power law fit, is a crossover temperature at which there is a change in the dynamics from the high-temperature homogeneous, diffusive relaxation to a heterogeneous, hopping-like motion. The hopping-like motion is evident in the probability distributions of the logarithm of single-particle displacements: approaching the commonly reported mode-coupling temperature these distributions start exhibiting two peaks. Notably, the temperature at which the hopping-like motion appears for the smaller particles is slightly higher than that at which the hopping-like motion appears for the larger ones. We define and calculate a new non-Gaussian parameter whose maximum occurs approximately at the time at which the two peaks in the probability distribution of the logarithm of displacements are most evident.},

  abstract = {The long-standing observations that different amorphous materials exhibit a pronounced enhancement of viscosity and eventually vitrify on compression or cooling continue to fascinate and challenge scientists, on the ground of their physical origin and practical implications. Glass formation is a generic phenomenon, observed in physically quite distinct systems that encompass hard and soft particles. It is believed that a common underlying scenario, namely cage formation, drives dynamical arrest, especially at high concentrations. Here, we identify a novel, asymmetric glassy state in soft colloidal mixtures, which is characterized by strongly anisotropically distorted cages, bearing similarities to those of hard-sphere glasses under shear. The anisotropy is induced by the presence of soft additives. This phenomenon seems to be generic to soft colloids and its origins lie in the penetrability of the constituent particles. The resulting phase diagram for mixtures of soft particles is clearly distinct from that of hard-sphere mixtures and brings forward a rich variety of vitrified states that delineate an ergodic lake in the parameter space spanned by the size ratio between the two components and by the concentration of the additives. Thus, a new route opens for the rational design of soft particles with desired tunable rheological properties.},

The size of this cooperatively rearranging region is shown to be determined by configuration restrictions in these glass-forming liquids and is expressed in terms of their configurational entropy. The result of the theory is a relation practically coinciding with the empirical WLF equation. Application of the theory to viscosimetric experiments permits evaluation of the ratio of the kinetic glass temperature Tg (derived from usual ``quasistatic\&apos;\&apos; experiments) to the equilibrium second-order transition temperature T 2 (indicated by either statistical-mechanical theory or extrapolations of experimental data) as well as the hindrance-free energy per molecule. These parameters have been evaluated for fifteen substances, the experimental data for which were available. Hindrance-free energies were found to be of the magnitude to be expected from consideration of molecular interaction energies. The values of Tg/T 2 thus obtained for these fifteen widely differing materials were found to be nearly the same, i.e., 1.30\ensuremath{\pm}8.4\%. Values for Tg/T 2 of nearly the same magnitude were derived by Bestul and Chang from calorimetric data.},

To achieve a realistic modeling of processes in the living cell based on biochemical data, it becomes necessary, therefore, to consider such effects. We describe a protocol based on Brownian dynamics simulation to characterize and quantify the effect of various forms of crowding on diffusion and bimolecular association in a simple model of interacting hard spheres. We show that by combining the elastic collision method for hard spheres and the mean field approach for hydrodynamic interaction (HI), our simulations capture the correct dynamics of a monodisperse system. The contributions from excluded volume effect and HI to the crowding effect are thus quantified. The dependence of the results on size distribution of each component in the system is illustrated, and the approach is applied as well to the crowding effect on electrostatic-driven association in both neutral and charged environments; values for effective diffusion constants and association rates are obtained for the specific conditions. The results from our simulation approach can be used to improve the modeling of cell signaling processes without additional computational burdens.},

The stimulation of protein aggregation by crowding might account for the existence of molecular chaperones that combat this effect. Positive results of crowding include enhancing the collapse of polypeptide chains into functional proteins, the assembly of oligomeric structures and the efficiency of action of some molecular chaperones and metabolic pathways.},

Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

  abstract = {The rate of protein diffusion in bacterial cytoplasm may constrain a variety of cellular functions and limit the rates of many biochemical reactions in vivo. In this paper, we report noninvasive measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. These measurements were made in two ways: by photobleaching of GFP fluorescence and by photoactivation of a red-emitting fluorescent state of GFP (M. B. Elowitz, M. G. Surette, P. E. Wolf, J. Stock, and S. Leibler, Curr. Biol. 7:809{\textendash}812, 1997). The apparent diffusion coefficient,Da , of GFP in E. coli DH5\ensuremath{\alpha} was found to be 7.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 2.5 \ensuremath{\mu}m2/s. A 72-kDa fusion protein composed of GFP and a cytoplasmically localized maltose binding protein domain moves more slowly, with Da of 2.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 \ensuremath{\mu}m2/s. In addition, GFP mobility can depend strongly on at least two factors: first,Da is reduced to 3.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 \ensuremath{\mu}m2/s at high levels of GFP expression; second, the addition to GFP of a small tag consisting of six histidine residues reduces Da to 4.0 \ensuremath{\pm} 2.0 \ensuremath{\mu}m2/s. Thus, a single effective cytoplasmic viscosity cannot explain all values of Da reported here. These measurements have implications for the understanding of intracellular biochemical networks.},

  abstract = {The very high concentration of macromolecules within cells can potentially have an overwhelming effect on the thermodynamic activity of cellular components because of excluded volume effects. To estimate the magnitudes of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes, concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be \ensuremath{\approx}0.3 to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: The ribosome {\textemdash} essential for protein synthesis in all organisms {\textemdash} has been an evasive target for structural studies. The best available structures for the 70S Escherichia coli ribosome or its 30S and 50S subunits are based on electron microscopical tilt experiments and are limited in resolution to 28{\textendash}55 {\aa}. The angular reconstitution approach, which exploits the random orientations of particles within a vitreous ice matrix, can be used in conjunction with cryo-electron microscopy to yield a higher-resolution structure.

Results Our 23 {\aa} resolution map of the 70S ribosome elucidates many structural details, such as an extensive system of channels within the 50S subunit and an inter-subunit gap ideally shaped to accommodate two transfer RNA molecules. The resolution achieved is sufficient to allow the preliminary fitting of double-helical regions of an earlier three-dimensional ribosomal RNA model.

Conclusion Although we are still a long way from attaining an atomic-resolution structure of the ribosome, cryo-electron microscopy, in combination with angular reconstitution, is likely to yield three-dimensional maps with gradually increasing resolution. As exemplified by our current 23 {\aa} reconstruction, these maps will lead to progressive refinement of models of the ribosomal RNA.},

The extract appears to play two roles in this transition, supplying both DNA-binding protein(s) and a crowded environment that increases protein binding and favors compact DNA conformations. The two roles of the extract are suggested by properties of fractions prepared by absorption of extracts with DNA-cellulose. The DNA-binding fraction and the DNA-nonbinding fractions from these columns are separately poorer condensing agents than the original extract, but when rejoined are similar to the original extract in the amount required for condensation. The dual role for the extract is supported by model studies of condensation with combinations of purified DNA-binding materials (protein HU or spermidine) and concentrated solutions of crowding agents (albumin or polyethylene glycol 8000); in each case, crowding agents and DNA-binding materials jointly reduce the amounts of each other required for condensation. The condensation reaction as studied in extracts or in the purified systems may be a useful approach to the forces which stabilize the compact form of DNA within the bacterial nucleoid.

The effect of condensation on the reactivity of the DNA was measured by changes in the rate of cohesion between duplex DNA molecules bearing the complementary single-strand termini of \ensuremath{\lambda} DNA. Condensation caused large increases in the rates of cohesion of both \ensuremath{\lambda} DNA and of restriction fragments of \ensuremath{\lambda} DNA bearing the cohesive termini. Cohesion products of \ensuremath{\lambda} DNA made in vitro are a mixture of linear and circular aggregates, whereas those made in vivo are cyclic monomers. We suggest a simple mechanism based upon condensation at the site of viral injection which may explain this discrepancy.},

  abstract = {The nonideal properties of solutions containing high concentrations of macromolecules can result in enormous increases in the activity of the individual macromolecules. It has been proposed that molecular crowding and confinement occur in cells and are major determinants of the activity of the proteins and other intracellular macromolecules. This concept has important implications for cell volume regulation because, under crowded conditions, relatively small changes in concentration, consequent to alterations of water content, lead to large changes in macromolecular activity. This review considers several aspects of macromolecular crowding and confinement, including: 1) the physical chemical principles involved; 2) in vitro demonstrations of the effects; 3) relation to water activity; 4) estimates of the actual intracellular activity of water and macromolecules; 5) relation to osmotic regulation in various types of cells, including bacteria, red blood cells, and complex nucleated cells; and 6) the relation to inorganic ions and organic osmolytes in cells stressed by hypertonicity. We conclude that, while there is compelling evidence for important effects of molecular crowding in vitro and in red blood cells, the role of macromolecular crowding and confinement in osmotic regulation of more complex cells is an open question that deserves the extensive attention it is currently receiving.},

  abstract = {The water-accessible volumes, the amounts of all significant osmolytes, and the protein concentration in the cytoplasm of aerobically grown Escherichia coli K-12 have been determined as a function of the osmolarity of the minimal growth medium. The volume of cytoplasmic water (V\=cyto) decreases linearly with increasing osmolarity from 2.23(\ensuremath{\pm}0.12) \ensuremath{\mu}l/mg dry weight in cells grown at 0.10 osm to 1.18(\ensuremath{\pm}0.06) \ensuremath{\mu}l/mg dry weight at 1.02 osm. Above 0.28 osm, growth rate decreases linearly with increasing osmolarity. The growth rate extrapolates to zero at an osmolarity of approximately 1.8, corresponding to an estimated V\=cyto of 0.5(\ensuremath{\pm}0.2) \ensuremath{\mu}l/mg dry weight. Measurements of V\=cyto in titrations of non-growing cells with the plasmolyzing agent NaCl were used to obtain volumes of {\textquotedblleft}bound{\textquotedblright} water (presumably water of macromolecular hydration) and cytoplasmic osmotic coefficients for cells grown in medium of low (0.10 osm) and moderate (0.28 osm) osmolarity. The volume of bound water V\=b is similar in the two osmotic conditions (V\=b = 0.40(\ensuremath{\pm}0.04) \ensuremath{\mu}l/mg dry wt), and corresponds to approximately 0.5 g H2O/g cytoplasmic macromolecule. Since V\=cyto decreases with increasing osmolarity, whereas V\=b appears to be independent of osmolarity, water of hydration becomes a larger fraction of V\=cyto as the osmolarity of the growth medium increases. Growth appears to cease at the osmolarity where V\=cyto is approximately equal to V\=b. K+ and glutamate (Glu-) are the only significant cytoplasmic osmolytes in cells grown in medium of low osmolarity. The amount of K+ greatly exceeds that of Glu-. Analysis of cytoplasmic electroneutrality indicates that the cytoplasm behaves like a concentrated solution of the K+ salt of cytoplasmic polyanions, in which the amount of additional electrolyte (K+ Glu-) increases with increasing osmolarity. As the osmolarity of the growth medium becomes very low, the cytoplasm approaches an electrolyte-free K+-polyanion solution. In vivo osmotic coefficients were determined from the variation of V\=cyto with external osmolarity in plasmolysis titrations of non-growing cells. The values obtained (\ensuremath{\varphi} = 0.54(\ensuremath{\pm}0.06) for cells grown at 0.10 osm and \ensuremath{\varphi} = 0.71(\ensuremath{\pm}0.11) at 0.28 osm) indicate a high degree of non-ideality of intracellular ions arising from coulombic interactions between K+ and cytoplasmic polyanions. Analysis of these osmotic coefficients using polyelectrolyte theory indicates that the thermodynamic activity of cytoplasmic K+ increases from approximately 0.14 m in cells grown at an external osmolarity of 0.10 osm to approximately 0.76 m at 1.02 osm. The amounts of protein and nucleic acid per unit cell dry weight appear to be independent of external osmolarity. Since V\=cyto decreases with external osmolarity, the concentration of cytoplasmic protein increases from approximately 200 mg/ml in cells grown at 0.10 osm to approximately 320 mg/ml at 1.02 osm. The RNA concentration increases from approximately 75 mg/ml to approximately 120 mg/ml over this range. Scaled particle theory predicts that this increase in macromolecular concentration will cause the activity coefficients of typical cytoplasmic proteins to increase by several orders of magnitude. Such an increase in activity coefficients of DNA-binding proteins with increasing osmolarity appears to be sufficient to counter the expected effect of the concomitant increase in the thermodynamic activity of K+ on protein-DNA interactions. This compensation may explain the anomalous lack of dependence of protein-DNA interactions in vivo on {[}K+] and external osmolarity. Differential crowding effects as a function of external osmolarity should affect cell phenotype. For example, the ability of high osmolarity to restore the wild-type phenotype of certain conditional lethal mutants of E. coli (classified as {\textquotedblleft}osmotic remedial{\textquotedblright} mutants) may be a manifestation of the effect of increased macromolecular crowding on the stability and assembly of proteins in the cytoplasm of cells grown at high osmolarity.},

The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components.},

We observed a regime of active random {\textquotedblleft}stirring{\textquotedblright} that constitutes an intermediate mode of transport, different from both thermal diffusion and directed motor activity. High-frequency motion was found to be thermally driven. At times greater than 100 milliseconds, nonequilibrium dynamics dominated.

We present a quantitative model connecting molecular mechanisms to mesoscopic fluctuations.

Cytoskeletal dynamics is key to cellular function. At very short time scales, thermal motions probably dominate, whereas on time scales from minutes to hours, motor-protein-12{\textendash}based directed transport is dominant. But what about the times in between? Fakhri et al. tracked kinesin molecules labeled with carbon nanotubes and monitored their motion in living cells for milliseconds to hours. The kinesins motored along microtubule tracks, but sometimes moved more randomly as the tracks themselves were moved by active, larger-scale cell movements. This active {\textquotedblleft}stirring{\textquotedblright} of the cytoplasm may play a role in nonspecific transport.

This technique combines measurements of the random motion of probe particles with independent micromechanical measurements of the cytoplasm to quantify the spectrum of force fluctuations. Using FSM, we show that force~fluctuations substantially enhance intracellular movement of small and large components. The fluctuations are three times larger in malignant cells than in their benign counterparts. We further demonstrate that vimentin acts globally to anchor organelles against randomly fluctuating forces in the cytoplasm, with no effect on their magnitude. Thus, FSM has broad applications for understanding the cytoplasm and its intracellular processes in relation to cell physiology in healthy and diseased states.},

The results are in close agreement with experimental or previously simulated values, where available. Control simulations without HI showed that use of HI is essential to obtain accurate diffusion coefficients. Anomalous diffusion inside the crowded cellular medium was investigated with Fractional Brownian motion analysis, and found to be present in this model.

  abstract = {Understanding gene expression requires the ability to follow the fate of individual molecules. Here we use a cellular system for monitoring messenger RNA (mRNA)expression to characterize the movement in real time of single mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) in the nucleus of living mammalian cells. This mobility was not directed but was governed by simple diffusion. Some mRNPs were partially corralled throughout the nonhomogenous nuclear environment, but no accumulation at subnuclear domains was observed. Following energy deprivation, energy-independent motion of mRNPs was observed in a highly ATP-dependent nuclear environment; movements were constrained to chromatin-poor domains and excluded by newly formed chromatin barriers. This observation resolves a controversy, showing that the energetic requirements of nuclear mRNP trafficking are consistent with a diffusional model.},

  abstract = {We review the effects of molecular crowding on solute diffusion in solution and in cellular aqueous compartments and membranes. Anomalous diffusion, in which mean squared displacement does not increase linearly with time, is predicted in simulations of solute diffusion in media crowded with fixed or mobile obstacles, or when solute diffusion is restricted or accelerated by a variety of geometric or active transport processes. Experimental measurements of solute diffusion in solutions and cellular aqueous compartments, however, generally show Brownian diffusion. In cell membranes, there are examples of both Brownian and anomalous diffusion, with the latter likely produced by lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. We conclude that the notion of universally anomalous diffusion in cells as a consequence of molecular crowding is not correct and that slowing of diffusion in cells is less marked than has been generally assumed.},

Weakly attractive systems differ little from dense hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones fluids. Particle motion is punctuated and tends to proceed in steps of roughly a single particle diameter. Both of these basic features change in the presence of appreciable short-ranged attractions. Transient periods of particle mobility and immobility cannot be discerned at intermediate attraction strength, for which structural relaxation is greatly enhanced. Strong attractions, known to dramatically inhibit relaxation, restore bimodality of particle motion. But in this regime, transiently mobile particles move in steps that are significantly more biased toward large displacements than those in the case of weak attractions. This modified feature of dynamical heterogeneity, which cannot be captured by conventional mode coupling theory, verifies recent predictions from a model of spatially correlated facilitating defects.},

Analyzing the statics and dynamics of both sets of particles, it is shown that the slow particles form a network of stuck particles, whereas the fast ones are able to move over long distances. Correlation functions show that the environment of the fast particles relaxes much faster than that of the slow ones, but at short times the bonds between fast particles are longer lived due to the flexibility of their structure. No stringlike motion is observed for the fast particles, but they occupy preferential sites in the surface of the structure formed by the slow ones.},

  abstract = {Recently we presented a new technique for numerical simulations of colloidal hard-sphere systems and showed its high efficiency. Here, we extend our calculations to the treatment of both 2- and 3-dimensional monodisperse and 3-dimensional polydisperse systems (with sampled finite Gaussian size distribution of particle radii), focusing on equilibrium pair distribution functions and structure factors as well as volume fractions of random close packing (RCP). The latter were determined using in principle the same technique as Woodcock or Stillinger had used. Results for the monodisperse 3-dimensional system show very good agreement compared to both pair distribution and structure factor predicted by the Percus-Yevick approximation for the fluid state (volume fractions up to 0.50). We were not able to find crystalline 3d systems at volume fractions 0.50{\textendash}0.58 as shown by former simulations of Reeet al. or experiments of Pusey and van Megen, due to the fact that we used random start configurations and no constraints of particle positions as in the cell model of Hoover and Ree, and effects of the overall entropy of the system, responsible for the melting and freezing phase transitions, are neglected in our calculations. Nevertheless, we obtained reasonable results concerning concentration-dependent long-time selfdiffusion coefficients (as shown before) and equilibrium structure of samples in the fluid state, and the determination of the volume fraction of random close packing (RCP, glassy state). As expected, polydispersity increases the respective volume fraction of RCP due to the decrease in free volume by the fraction of the smaller spheres which fill gaps between the larger particles.},

The density and polydispersity of the precipitate are characterized by a single curve, regardless of the composition of the fluid from which it is formed. Fractionation enables a fluid of arbitrary polydispersity to precipitate a solid of small polydispersity, dispeling the long-held notion of a fluid-phase {\textquotedblleft}critical{\textquotedblright} polydispersity, beyond which it cannot form a solid. Nevertheless, a primary conclusion from the previous study is confirmed: a solid crystalline phase of polydispersity exceeding 5.7\% of the average sphere diameter cannot be precipitated from a fluid phase.},

While a decade ago minimalist toy models were mainly designed to test general hypotheses on the principles regulating protein folding, the latest coarse-grained models are increasingly realistic and can be used to characterize quantitatively the detailed folding mechanism of specific proteins. The ability of such models to reproduce the essential features of folding dynamics suggests that each single atomic degree of freedom is not by itself particularly relevant to folding and supports a statistical mechanical approach to characterize folding transitions. When combined with more refined models and with experimental studies, the systematic investigation of protein systems and complexes using coarse-grained models can advance our theoretical understanding of the actual organizing principles that emerge from the complex network of interactions among protein atomic constituents.},

  abstract =     {We present a Bayesian statistical analysis of the conformations of side chains in proteins from the Protein Data Bank. This is an extension of the backbone-dependent rotamer library, and includes rotamer populations and average x angles for a full range of {\o},$\psi$ values. The Bayesian analysis used here provides a rigorous statistical method for taking account of varying amounts of data. Bayesian statistics requires the assumption of a prior distribution for parameters over their range of possible values. This prior distribution can be derived from previous data or from pooling some of the present data. The prior distribution is combined with the data to form the posterior distribution, which is a compromise between the prior distribution and the data. For the X2, X3, and X4 rotamer prior distributions, we assume that the probability of each rotamer type is dependent only on the previous X rotamer in the chain. For the backbone-dependence of the x1 rotamers, we derive prior distributions from the product of the {\o}-dependent and $\psi$-dependent probabilities. Molecular mechanics calculations with the {CHARMM22} potential show a strong similarity with the experimental distributions, indicating that proteins attain their lowest energy rotamers with respect to local backbone-side-chain interactions. The new library is suitable for use in homology modeling, protein folding simulations, and the refinement of X-ray and {NMR} structures.},

  abstract =     {An algorithm has been developed which identifies alpha-helices involved in the interactions of membrane proteins with lipid bilayers and which distinguishes them from helices in soluble proteins. The membrane-associated helices are then classified with the aid of the hydrophobic moment plot, on which the hydrophobic moment of each helix is plotted as a function of its hydrophobicity. The magnitude of hydrophobic moment measures the amphiphilicity of the helix (and hence its tendency to seek a surface between hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases), and the hydrophobicity measures its affinity for the membrane interior. Segments of membrane proteins in alpha-helices tend to fall in one of three regions of a hydrophobic moment plot: (1) monomeric transmembrane anchors (class I HLA transmembrane sequences) lie in the region of highest hydrophobicity and smallest hydrophobic moment; (2) helices presumed to be paired (such as the transmembrane M segments of surface immunoglobulins) and helices which are bundled together in membranes (such as bacteriorhodopsin) fall in the adjacent region with higher hydrophobic moment and smaller hydrophobicity; and (3) helices from surface-seeking proteins (such as melittin) fall in the region with still higher hydrophobic moment. alpha-Helices from globular proteins mainly fall in a region of lower mean hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment. Application of these methods to the sequence of diphtheria toxin suggests four transmembrane helices and a surface-seeking helix in fragment B, the moiety known to have transmembrane function.},

Optical methods, solid state NMR, ESR and X-ray scattering can also provide valuable information regarding the ensemble of conformations sampled by disordered states. Finally, computational studies have begun to assume an increasingly important role in interpreting and extending the impact of experimental data obtained for such systems.

General simulation techniques are derived which are independent of the form of the memory function.

In doubly transgenic mice, beta-synuclein ameliorated motor deficits, neurodegenerative alterations, and neuronal alpha-synuclein accumulation seen in halpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Similarly, cell lines transfected with beta-synuclein were resistant to alpha-synuclein accumulation. halpha-synuclein was coimmunoprecipitated with hbeta-synuclein in the brains of doubly transgenic mice and in the double-transfected cell lines. Our results raise the possibility that beta-synuclein might be a natural negative regulator of alpha-synuclein aggregation and that a similar class of endogenous factors might regulate the aggregation state of other molecules involved in neurodegeneration. Such an anti-amyloidogenic property of beta-synuclein might also provide a novel strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.},

The 140 amino acid protein is identical with the precursor of the non-A beta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid which in turn is highly homologous to synuclein from Torpedo electroplaques and rat brain. The 134 amino acid protein is the human homologue of bovine phosphoneuroprotein 14; it is 61\% identical in sequence to the 140 amino acid protein. The previously unrecognised homology between these two proteins defines a family of human brain synucleins. We refer to the 140 and 134 amino acid proteins as alpha-synuclein and beta-synuclein, respectively.

  abstract =     {Small-angle neutron scattering was used to examine the effects of molecular crowding on an intrinsically disordered protein, the N protein of bacteriophage $\lambda$, in the presence of high concentrations of a small globular protein, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). The N protein was labeled with deuterium, and the D(2)O concentration of the solvent was adjusted to eliminate the scattering contrast between the solvent and unlabeled BPTI, leaving only the scattering signal from the unfolded protein. The scattering profile observed in the absence of BPTI closely matched that predicted for an ensemble of random conformations. With BPTI added to a concentration of 65 mg/mL, there was a clear change in the scattering profile representing an increase in the mass fractal dimension of the unfolded protein, from 1.7 to 1.9, as expected if crowding favors more compact conformations. The crowding protein also inhibited aggregation of the unfolded protein. At 130 mg/mL BPTI, however, the fractal dimension was not significantly different from that measured at the lower concentration, contrary to the predictions of models that treat the unfolded conformations as convex particles. These results are reminiscent of the behavior of polymers in concentrated melts, suggesting that these synthetic mixtures may provide useful insights into the properties of unfolded proteins under crowding conditions.},

All three proteins were natively unfolded under physiological conditions but adopted identical partially-folded conformations under conditions of acidic {pH} or high temperature. The initial kinetic event in the fibrillation of all three $\alpha$-synucleins was shown to be the formation of a partially-folded intermediate with properties close to those described for these proteins at acidic {pH} or at high temperatures. Both mutants showed a greater propensity to form non-fibrillar aggregates than wild-type protein. All three proteins formed fibrils faster in the presence of heparin, although substantially higher concentrations were required for the {A30P} mutant. In contrast to the wild-type and {A53T} proteins, in which fibrillation was further accelerated by the presence of the pesticide diethyldithiocarbamate {(DDC)}, the {A30P} mutant was inhibited by {DDC.} The mutant proteins had significantly lower affinity for {DDC} than the {WT.} A model of the effect of mutations on the aggregation behavior of $\alpha$-synuclein is proposed, which explains the different effects of exogenous agents on the three proteins, based on different kinetic partitioning along pathways leading to fibrils and to non-fibrillar aggregates.},

  abstract =     {Intrinsically disordered proteins {(IDPs)} adopt heterogeneous ensembles of conformations under physiological conditions. Understanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and conformational ensembles of {IDPs} can help clarify the role of disorder in physiological function. Recent studies revealed that polar {IDPs} favor collapsed ensembles in water despite the absence of hydrophobic groups---a result that holds for polypeptide backbones as well. By studying highly charged polypeptides, a different archetype of {IDPs}, we assess how charge content modulates the intrinsic preference of polypeptide backbones for collapsed structures. We characterized conformational ensembles for a set of protamines in aqueous milieus using molecular simulations and fluorescence measurements. Protamines are arginine-rich {IDPs} involved in the condensation of chromatin during spermatogenesis. Simulations based on the {ABSINTH} implicit solvation model predict the existence of a globule-to-coil transition, with net charge per residue serving as the discriminating order parameter. The transition is supported by quantitative agreement between simulation and experiment. Local conformational preferences partially explain the observed trends of polymeric properties. Our results lead to the proposal of a schematic protein phase diagram that should enable prediction of polymeric attributes for {IDP} conformational ensembles using easily calculated physicochemical properties of amino acid sequences. Although sequence composition allows the prediction of polymeric properties, interresidue contact preferences of protamines with similar polymeric attributes suggest that certain details of conformational ensembles depend on the sequence. This provides a plausible mechanism for specificity in the functions of {IDPs.}},

The structural representation of these disordered states as ensembles of interconverting conformers can therefore provide critical insights. Experimental methods can be used to probe ensemble-averaged structural properties of disordered states and computational approaches generate representative ensembles of conformers using experimental restraints. In particular, NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering provide quantitative data that can readily be incorporated into calculations. These techniques have gleaned structural information about denatured, unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins. The use of experimental data in different computational approaches, including ensemble molecular dynamics simulations and algorithms that assign populations to pregenerated conformers, has highlighted the presence of both local and long-range structure, and the occurrence of native-like and non-native interactions in unfolded and denatured states. Analysis of the resulting ensembles has suggested important implications of this fluctuating structure for folding, aggregation and binding.},

Accordingly, a series of 18-residue amphipathic alpha-helical peptides has been synthesized as a model system where all 20 amino acid residues were substituted on the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic alpha-helix. In these experiments, all three parameters (sidechain hydrophobicity, alpha-helical propensity and helix stability) were measured on the same set of peptide analogues. For these peptide analogues that differ by only one amino acid residue, there was a 0.96 kcal/mole difference in alpha-helical propensity between the most (Ala) and the least (Gly) alpha-helical analogue, a 12.1-minute difference between the most (Phe) and the least (Asp) retentive analogue on the reversed-phase column, and a 32.3 degrees C difference in melting temperatures between the most (Leu) and the least (Asp) stable analogue. The results show that the hydrophobicity and alpha-helical propensity of an amino acid sidechain are not correlated with each other, but each contributes to the stability of the amphipathic alpha-helix. More importantly, the combined effects of alpha-helical propensity and sidechain hydrophobicity at a ratio of about 2:1 had optimal correlation with alpha-helix stability. These results suggest that both alpha-helical propensity and sidechain hydrophobicity should be taken into consideration in the design of alpha-helical proteins with the desired stability.},

  abstract =     {Alzheimer disease is characterized by abnormal protein deposits in the brain, such as extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The tangles are made of a protein called tau comprising 441 residues in its longest isoform. Tau belongs to the class of natively unfolded proteins, binds to and stabilizes microtubules, and partially folds into an ordered beta-structure during aggregation to Alzheimer paired helical filaments (PHFs). Here we show that it is possible to overcome the size limitations that have traditionally hampered detailed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies of such large nonglobular proteins. This is achieved using optimal NMR pulse sequences and matching of chemical shifts from smaller segments in a divide and conquer strategy. The methodology reveals that 441-residue tau is highly dynamic in solution with a distinct domain character and an intricate network of transient long-range contacts important for pathogenic aggregation. Moreover, the single-residue view provided by the NMR analysis reveals unique insights into the interaction of tau with microtubules. Our results establish that NMR spectroscopy can provide detailed insight into the structural polymorphism of very large nonglobular proteins.},

Such intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often contain a large fraction of charged amino acids. Here, we use single-molecule F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer to investigate the influence of charged residues on the dimensions of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins. We find that, in contrast to the compact unfolded conformations that have been observed for many proteins at low denaturant concentration, IDPs can exhibit a prominent expansion at low ionic strength that correlates with their net charge. Charge-balanced polypeptides, however, can exhibit an additional collapse at low ionic strength, as predicted by polyampholyte theory from the attraction between opposite charges in the chain. The pronounced effect of charges on the dimensions of unfolded proteins has important implications for the cellular functions of IDPs.},

  abstract =     {Tau is one of the two main proteins involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease via formation of beta-sheet rich intracellular aggregates named paired helical filaments (PHFs). Given that tau is a natively unfolded protein with no folded core (even upon binding to physiological partners such as microtubules), its structural analysis by high-resolution techniques has been difficult. In this study, employing solution small-angle X-ray scattering from the full length isoforms and from a variety of deletion and point mutants the conformation of tau in solution is structurally characterized. A recently developed ensemble optimization method was employed to generate pools of random models and to select ensembles of coexisting conformations, which fitted simultaneously the scattering data from the full length protein and deletion mutants. The analysis of the structural properties of these selected ensembles allowed us to extract information about residual structure in different domains of the native protein. The short deletion mutants containing the repeat domain (considered the core constituent of the PHFs) are significantly more extended than random coils, suggesting an extended conformation of the repeat domain. The longer tau constructs are comparable in size with the random coils, pointing to long-range contacts between the N- and C-termini compensating for the extension of the repeat domain. Moreover, most of the aggregation-promoting mutants did not show major differences in structure from their wild-type counterparts, indicating that their increased pathological effect is triggered only after an aggregation core has been formed.},

  abstract =     {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

  abstract =     {Protein folding is inherently a heterogeneous process because of the very large number of microscopic pathways that connect the myriad unfolded conformations to the unique conformation of the native structure. In a first step towards the long-range goal of describing the distribution of pathways experimentally, F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer {(FRET)} has been measured on single, freely diffusing molecules. Here we use this method to determine properties of the free-energy surface for folding that have not been obtained from ensemble experiments. We show that single-molecule {FRET} measurements of a small cold-shock protein expose equilibrium collapse of the unfolded polypeptide and allow us to calculate limits on the polypeptide reconfiguration time. From these results, limits on the height of the free-energy barrier to folding are obtained that are consistent with a simple statistical mechanical model, but not with the barriers derived from simulations using molecular dynamics. Unlike the activation energy, the free-energy barrier includes the activation entropy and thus has been elusive to experimental determination for any kinetic process in solution.},

  abstract =     {Solubility and vapor pressure measurements of hydrocarbons in water are generally thought to provide estimates of the strength of the hydrophobic effect in the range 20-30 cal/(mol.A2). Our reassessment of the solubility data on the basis of new developments in solution thermodynamics suggests that the hydrophobic surface free energy for hydrocarbon solutes is 46-47 cal/(mol.A2), although the actual value depends strongly on curvature effects [Nicholls et al. (1991) Proteins (in press); Sharp et al. (1991) Science 252, 106-109]. The arguments to support such a significant increase in the estimate of the hydrophobic effect stem partly from theoretical considerations and partly from the experimental results of De Young and Dill [(1990) J. Phys. Chem. 94, 801-809] on benzene partition between water and alkane solvents. Previous estimates of the hydrophobic effect derive from an analysis of solute partition data, which does not fully account for changes in volume entropy. We show here how the ideal gas equations, combined with experimental molar volumes, can account for such changes. Revised solubility scales for the 20 amino acids, based on cyclohexane to water and octanol to water transfer energies, are derived. The agreement between these scales, particularly the octanol scale, and mutant protein stability measurements from Kellis et al. [(1989) Biochemistry 28, 4914-4922] and Shortle et al. [(1990) Biochemistry 29, 8033-8041] is good. The increased strength of the hydrophobic interaction has implications for the energetics of protein folding, substrate binding, and nucleic acid base stacking and the interpretation of computer simulations.},

  abstract =     {Protein folding and binding are analogous processes, in which the protein 'searches' for favourable intramolecular or intermolecular interactions on a funnelled energy landscape. Many eukaryotic proteins are disordered under physiological conditions, and fold into ordered structures only on binding to their cellular targets. The mechanism by which folding is coupled to binding is poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized on theoretical grounds that the binding kinetics may be enhanced by a 'fly-casting' effect, where the disordered protein binds weakly and non-specifically to its target and folds as it approaches the cognate binding site. Here we show, using NMR titrations and (15)N relaxation dispersion, that the phosphorylated kinase inducible activation domain (pKID) of the transcription factor CREB forms an ensemble of transient encounter complexes on binding to the KIX domain of the CREB binding protein. The encounter complexes are stabilized primarily by non-specific hydrophobic contacts, and evolve by way of an intermediate to the fully bound state without dissociation from KIX. The carboxy-terminal helix of pKID is only partially folded in the intermediate, and becomes stabilized by intermolecular interactions formed in the final bound state. Future applications of our method will provide new understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which intrinsically disordered proteins perform their diverse biological functions.},

The evidence that these proteins exist without a well-defined folded structure in vitro is compelling, and justifies considering them a separate class within the protein world. In this paper, novel advances in the rapidly advancing field of IUPs are reviewed, with the major attention directed to the evidence of their unfolded character in vivo, the interplay of their residual structure and their various functional modes and the functional benefits their malleable structural state provides. Via all these details, it is demonstrated that in only a couple of years after its conception, the idea of protein disorder has already come of age and transformed our basic concepts of protein structure and function.},

  abstract =     {$\alpha$-Synuclein {($\alpha$S)} is an intrinsically disordered protein whose aggregation into ordered, fibrillar structures underlies the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. A full understanding of the factors that cause its conversion from soluble protein to insoluble aggregate requires characterization of the conformations of the monomer protein under conditions that favor aggregation. Here we use single molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer to probe the structure of several aggregation-prone states of {$\alpha$S.} Both low {pH} and charged molecules have been shown to accelerate the aggregation of {$\alpha$S} and induce conformational changes in the protein. We find that at low {pH}, the C-terminus of {$\alpha$S} undergoes substantial collapse, with minimal effect on the N-terminus and central region. The proximity of the N- and C-termini and the global dimensions of the protein are relatively unaffected by the C-terminal collapse. Moreover, although compact at low {pH}, with restricted chain motion, the structure of the C-terminus appears to be random. Low {pH} has a dramatically different effect on {$\alpha$S} structure than the molecular aggregation inducers spermine and heparin. Binding of these molecules gives rise to only minor conformational changes in {$\alpha$S}, suggesting that their mechanism of aggregation enhancement is fundamentally different from that of low {pH.}},

We analyzed the entire amino acid sequences in an amyloid preparation and found, in addition to the major beta/A4-protein (A beta) fragment, two unknown peptides. We raised antibodies against synthetic peptides using subsequences of these peptides. These antibodies immunostained amyloid in neuritic and diffuse plaques as well as vascular amyloid. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the immunostaining was localized on amyloid fibrils. We have isolated an apparently full-length cDNA encoding a 140-amino-acid protein within which two previously unreported amyloid sequences are encoded in tandem in the most hydrophobic domain. We tentatively named this 35-amino acid peptide NAC (non-A beta component of AD amyloid) and its precursor NACP. NAC is the second component, after A beta, identified chemically in the purified AD amyloid preparation. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the NAC peptide sequence has a strong tendency to form beta-structures consistent with its association with amyloid. NACP is detected as a M(r) 19,000 protein in the cytosolic fraction of brain homogenates and comigrates on immunoblots with NACP synthesized in Escherichia coli from NACP cDNA. NACP mRNA is expressed principally in brain but is also expressed in low concentrations in all tissues examined except in liver, suggesting its ubiquitous and brain-specific functions. The availability of the cDNA encoding full-length NACP should help to elucidate the mechanisms of amyloidosis in AD.},

Here, the structure and dynamics of micelle-bound aS are reported. Val3-Val37 and Lys45-Thr92 form curved $\alpha$-helices, connected by a well ordered, extended linker in an unexpected anti-parallel arrangement, followed by another short extended region (Gly93-Lys97), overlapping the recently identified chaperone-mediated autophagy recognition motif and a highly mobile tail (Asp98-Ala140). Helix curvature is significantly less than predicted based on the native micelle shape, indicating a deformation of the micelle by aS. Structural and dynamic parameters show a reduced helical content for Ala30-Val37. A dynamic variation in interhelical distance on the microsecond timescale is complemented by enhanced sub-nanosecond timescale dynamics, particularly in the remarkably glycine-rich segments of the helices. These unusually rich dynamics may serve to mitigate the effect of aS binding on membrane fluidity. The well ordered conformation of the helix-helix connector indicates a defined interaction with lipidic surfaces, suggesting that, when bound to larger diameter synaptic vesicles, it can act as a switch between this structure and a previously proposed uninterrupted helix.},

The properties of nitrated $\alpha$-synuclein were investigated using a variety of biophysical and biochemical techniques, which revealed that nitration led to formation of a partially folded conformation with increased secondary structure relative to the intrinsically disordered structure of the monomer, and to oligomerization at neutral {pH.} The degree of self-association was concentration-dependent, but at 1 {mg/mL}, nitrated $\alpha$-synuclein was predominantly an octamer. At low {pH}, small-angle X-ray scattering data indicated that the nitrated protein was monomeric. {$\alpha$-Synuclein} fibrillation at neutral {pH} was completely inhibited by nitrotyrosination and is attributed to the formation of stable soluble oligomers. The presence of heparin or metals did not overcome the inhibition; however, the inhibitory effect was eliminated at low {pH.} The addition of nitrated $\alpha$-synuclein inhibited fibrillation of non-modified $\alpha$-synuclein at neutral {pH.} Potential implications of these findings to the etiology of Parkinson's disease are discussed.},

They are highly abundant in nature and their functional repertoire complements the functions of ordered proteins. IDPs are involved in regulation, signaling, and control, where binding to multiple partners and high-specificity/low-affinity interactions play a crucial role. Functions of IDPs are tuned via alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications. Intrinsic disorder is a unique structural feature that enables IDPs to participate in both one-to-many and many-to-one signaling. Numerous IDPs are associated with human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidoses, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Overall, intriguing interconnections among intrinsic disorder, cell signaling, and human diseases suggest that protein conformational diseases may result not only from protein misfolding, but also from misidentification, missignaling, and unnatural or nonnative folding. IDPs, such as alpha-synuclein, tau protein, p53, and BRCA1, are attractive targets for drugs modulating protein-protein interactions. From these and other examples, novel strategies for drug discovery based on IDPs have been developed. To summarize work in this area, we are introducing the D2 (disorder in disorders) concept.},

The evolutionary persistence of such proteins represents strong evidence in the favor of their importance and raises intriguing questions about the role of protein disorders in biological processes. Additionally, natively unfolded proteins, with their lack of ordered structure, represent attractive targets for the biophysical studies of the unfolded polypeptide chain under physiological conditions in vitro. The goal of this study was to summarize the structural information on natively unfolded proteins in order to evaluate their major conformational characteristics. It appeared that natively unfolded proteins are characterized by low overall hydrophobicity and large net charge. They possess hydrodynamic properties typical of random coils in poor solvent, or premolten globule conformation. These proteins show a low level of ordered secondary structure and no tightly packed core. They are very flexible, but may adopt relatively rigid conformations in the presence of natural ligands. Finally, in comparison with the globular proteins, natively unfolded polypeptides possess 'turn out' responses to changes in the environment, as their structural complexities increase at high temperature or at extreme pH.},

The synucleins are natively unfolded proteins. beta-Synuclein, which lacks 11 central hydrophobic residues compared with its homologs, exhibited the properties of a random coil, whereas alpha- and gamma-synucleins were slightly more compact and structured. gamma-Synuclein, unlike its homologs, formed a soluble oligomer at relatively low concentrations, which appears to be an off-fibrillation pathway species. Here we show that, although they have similar biophysical properties to alpha-synuclein, beta- And gamma-synucleins inhibit alpha-synuclein fibril formation. Complete inhibition of alpha-synuclein fibrillation was observed at 4:1 molar excess of beta- and gamma-synucleins. No significant incorporation of beta-synuclein into the fibrils was detected. The lack of fibrils formed by beta-synuclein is most readily explained by the absence of a stretch of hydrophobic residues from the middle region of the protein. A model for the inhibition is proposed.},

In Parkinson's disease it is believed that the aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$-syn) from monomers by intermediates into amyloid fibrils is the toxic disease-causative mechanism. Here, we studied the structure of $\alpha$-syn in its amyloid state by using various biophysical approaches. Quenched hydrogen/deuterium exchange NMR spectroscopy identified five $\beta$-strands within the fibril core comprising residues 35--96 and solid-state NMR data from amyloid fibrils comprising the fibril core residues 30--110 confirmed the presence of $\beta$-sheet secondary structure. The data suggest that $\beta$1-strand interacts with $\beta$2, $\beta$2 with $\beta$3, $\beta$3 with $\beta$4, and $\beta$4 with $\beta$5. High-resolution cryoelectron microscopy revealed the protofilament boundaries of $\approx$2 $\times$ 3.5 nm. Based on the combination of these data and published structural studies, a fold of $\alpha$-syn in the fibrils is proposed and discussed.},

  abstract =     {Intrinsically disordered proteins are characterized by long regions lacking 3-D structure in their native states, yet they have been so far associated with 28 distinguishable functions. Previous studies showed that protein predictors trained on disorder from one type of protein often achieve poor accuracy on disorder of proteins of a different type, thus indicating significant differences in sequence properties among disordered proteins. Important biological problems are identifying different types, or flavors, of disorder and examining their relationships with protein function. Innovative use of computational methods is needed in addressing these problems due to relative scarcity of experimental data and background knowledge related to protein disorder. We developed an algorithm that partitions protein disorder into flavors based on competition among increasing numbers of predictors, with prediction accuracy determining both the number of distinct predictors and the partitioning of the individual proteins. Using 145 variously characterized proteins with long (>30 amino acids) disordered regions, 3 flavors, called V, C, and S, were identified by this approach, with the V subset containing 52 segments and 7743 residues, C containing 39 segments and 3402 residues, and S containing 54 segments and 5752 residues. The V, C, and S flavors were distinguishable by amino acid compositions, sequence locations, and biological function. For the sequences in SwissProt and 28 genomes, their protein functions exhibit correlations with the commonness and usage of different disorder flavors, suggesting different flavor-function sets across these protein groups. Overall, the results herein support the flavor-function approach as a useful complement to structural genomics as a means for automatically assigning possible functions to sequences.},

PISCES can provide lists culled from the entire PDB or from lists of PDB entries or chains provided by the user. The sequence identities are obtained from PSI-BLAST alignments with position-specific substitution matrices derived from the non-redundant protein sequence database. PISCES therefore provides better lists than servers that use BLAST, which is unable to identify many relationships below 40% sequence identity and often overestimates sequence identity by aligning only well-conserved fragments. PDB sequences are updated weekly. PISCES can also cull non-PDB sequences provided by the user as a list of GenBank identifiers, a FASTA format file, or BLAST/PSI-BLAST output.

Progress toward this objective is summarized in this review by means of a thermodynamic framework for describing membrane protein folding and stability. The framework includes a coherent thermodynamic formalism for determining and describing the energetics of peptide-bilayer interactions and a review of the properties of the environment of membrane proteins--the bilayer milieu. Using a four-step thermodynamic cycle as a guide, advances in three main aspects of membrane protein folding energetics are discussed: protein binding and folding in bilayer interfaces, transmembrane helix insertion, and helix-helix interactions. The concepts of membrane protein stability that emerge provide insights to fundamental issues of protein folding.},

A quantitative description of the coupling of structure formation to partitioning, which may provide a basis for understanding membrane protein folding and insertion, requires an appropriate free energy scale for partitioning. A complete interfacial hydrophobicity scale that includes the contribution of the peptide bond was therefore determined from the partitioning of two series of small model peptides into the interfaces of neutral (zwitterionic) phospholipid membranes. Aromatic residues are found to be especially favoured at the interface while charged residues, and the peptide bond, are disfavoured about equally. Reduction of the high cost of partitioning the peptide bond through hydrogen bonding may be important in the promotion of structure formation in the membrane interface.},

  abstract =     {$\alpha$-Synuclein is an intrinsically disordered protein that appears in aggregated forms in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. The conversion from monomer to aggregate is complex, and aggregation rates are sensitive to changes in amino acid sequence and environmental conditions. It has previously been observed that $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates faster at low {pH} than at neutral {pH.} Here, we combine {NMR} spectroscopy and molecular simulations to characterize $\alpha$-synuclein conformational ensembles at both neutral and low {pH} in order to understand how the altered charge distribution at low {pH} changes the structural properties of these ensembles and leads to an increase in aggregation rate. The N-terminus, which has a small positive charge at neutral {pH} due to a balance of positively and negatively charged amino acid residues, is very positively charged at low {pH.} Conversely, the acidic C-terminus is highly negatively charged at neutral {pH} and becomes essentially neutral and hydrophobic at low {pH.} Our {NMR} experiments and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations indicate that there is a significant structural reorganization within the low-{pH} ensemble relative to that at neutral {pH} in terms of long-range contacts, hydrodynamic radius, and the amount of heterogeneity within the conformational ensembles. At neutral {pH}, there is a very heterogeneous ensemble with transient contacts between the N-terminus and the non-amyloid $\beta$ component {(NAC);} however, at low {pH}, there is a more homogeneous ensemble that exhibits strong contacts between the {NAC} and the C-terminus. At both {pH} values, transient contacts between the N- and C-termini are observed, the {NAC} region shows similar exposure to solvent, and the entire protein shows similar propensities to secondary structure. Based on the comparison of the neutral- and low-{pH} conformational ensembles, we propose that exposure of the {NAC} region to solvent and the secondary-structure propensity are not factors that account for differences in propensity to aggregate in this context. Instead, the comparison of the neutral- and low-{pH} ensembles suggests that the change in long-range interactions between the low- and neutral-{pH} ensembles, the compaction of the C-terminal region at low {pH}, and the uneven distribution of charges across the sequence are key to faster aggregation.},

In contrast, our approach is to develop robust physics- and geometry-based methods. Here, we investigate to what extent simple hard-sphere models can be used to predict side-chain conformations. The distributions of the side-chain dihedral angle $\chi$(1) of Val and Thr in proteins of known structure show distinctive features: Val side chains predominantly adopt $\chi$(1) = 180$\,^{\circ}$, whereas Thr side chains typically adopt $\chi$(1) = 60$\,^{\circ}$ and 300$\,^{\circ}$ (i.e., $\chi$(1) = $\pm$60$\,^{\circ}$ or g- and g(+) configurations). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these differences, including interresidue steric clashes and hydrogen-bonding interactions. In contrast, we show that the observed side-chain dihedral angle distributions for both Val and Thr can be explained using only local steric interactions in a dipeptide mimetic. Our results emphasize the power of simple physical approaches and their importance for future advances in protein engineering and design.},
